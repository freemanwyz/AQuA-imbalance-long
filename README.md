This is an exprimental version of AQuA for long and imbalanced events, which means an event may not go back to the baseline after becoming bright.

There are two presets:
1. Data1_avg_5_short_propagation is for 190405_s1_002_avg5.tif
2. Data2_avg_5_long_propagation is for 190405_s2_005_avg5.tif

For further details, see AQuA [main repository](https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA).
